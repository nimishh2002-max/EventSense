You are an expert AI systems architect.

I am building a hackathon project called “AgenticAI Event Intelligence”.
This is NOT a chatbot and NOT simple automation.

Goal:
Design an agentic, memory-driven decision-support system for college campus event planning that:
- auto-generates event details from minimal input (e.g., event name)
- analyzes risk using explainable logic
- compares against past events using institutional memory
- prevents repeated mistakes
- generates:
  1) internal decision intelligence reports
  2) a public-facing marketing event website

Core principles:
- Multi-agent architecture (each agent has a single responsibility)
- Human-in-the-loop (no fully autonomous decisions)
- Explainable logic over black-box ML
- Memory must be evidence-based, not hallucinated

Agents (must be explicit):
1. Event Context Inference Agent – expands minimal input into structured event details with confidence levels
2. Event Classification Agent – normalizes event attributes for risk & memory comparison
3. Event RAG Agent – shared, read-only retrieval of rules, SOPs, safety guidelines, planning docs
4. Event Risk Analysis Agent – rule-based risk scoring
5. Memory Retrieval Agent – fetches similar past events from memory DB (no reasoning)
6. Similarity & Evidence Agent – computes similarity, adjusts risk, extracts evidence
7. Decision Intelligence Assembler – produces structured insights & recommendations
8. Marketing Website Generator Agent – generates a colorful public landing page (no risks or memory exposed)
9. Memory Update Module – stores post-event outcomes after human confirmation

Memory design:
- Use TWO vector stores:
  1) Event Knowledge DB (RAG): rules, SOPs, safety guidelines
  2) Event Memory DB: past events, issues, severity, lessons learned
- Memory starts empty (cold start is expected)
- Memory is READ-only during planning
- Memory is WRITE-only after event completion
- Memory updates require explicit human validation

Event lifecycle:
DRAFT → ANALYZED → CONFIRMED → COMPLETED
- Memory read allowed in ANALYZED & CONFIRMED
- Memory write allowed ONLY after COMPLETED
- Event completion must be triggered by a human (“Mark Event as Completed”)

UI requirements (dashboard, not chat):
- Minimal input (event name)
- Auto-generated event profile with confidence indicators
- Tabs: Overview | Risk | Memory (historical evidence) | Website
- Separate Post-Event Review UI for memory updates

Outputs must include:
- Numeric risk score + level
- Similarity scores with past events
- Historical evidence & lessons learned
- Clear explanations
- Actionable recommendations
- Marketing website

Use Gemini as the core reasoning LLM.
Think like a systems architect, not a chatbot.
Avoid buzzwords. Keep it hackathon-feasible.
