EVENT ID: 2022-HACKATHON-FALL
Type: Academic
Outcome: Issue (Logistics)
Description: The main WiFi network crashed 2 hours into the event due to too many simultaneous connections (3 devices per student).

Type: Fundraiser
Outcome: Success
Description: Heavy rain started 1 hour before the event. Because the "Rain Plan" was activated at noon, the transition to the Student Union ballroom was seamless.
